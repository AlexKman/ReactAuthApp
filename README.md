Within this project I am creating a full scale react application. Currently beginning with the authentication layer through firebase and using React Bootstrap

Resources used:

1. https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html
2. https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
